This is an assignment for my Bloc Web Developer Bootcamp for a static web page to practice my basic semantic HTML and CSS skills.  This is the first web page that I have ever created.  My name is Steve Karagan and I reside in New York City.

This repo incorporates the changes requested by the grading team on 11/12.  I have re-run NU HTML checker and there were not errors or warnings to show.
